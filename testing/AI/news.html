<h2>1. XYZ Launches AI Product for Bone CT Scan Interpretation</h2>
<p>28 October, 2021.</p>
<p>Today we launched a new AI-powered technology to accurately identify bleeds, fractures and other critical abnormalities in head CT scans. We have also released the results of an unprecedented clinical validation study confirming the algorithms’ near-radiologist performance on 21,000 patients and made a dataset of almost 500 AI-analyzed head CT scans available for download.</p>
<p>We trained the new AI using a collection of 313,318 anonymized head CT scans, along with their corresponding clinical reports. Of these, 21,095 scans were then used to validate the algorithms. Finally, the AI was clinically validated on 491 CT scans, with the results compared against a panel of three senior radiologists. The panel of radiologists included Norbert G. Campeau, M.D., a senior neuro-radiologist from the Mayo Clinic’s Department of Radiology. The validation study found that our AI was more than 95% accurate in identifying abnormalities. </p>
<h2>2. XYZ.ai at STEM 2021 </h2>
<p>10 September, 2021</p>
<p> XYZ.ai will be part of ‘start-up street’ at STEM 2021, where we will demonstrate our deep learing solutions for CT Scan. Meet us at booth 132. The STEM 2021 conference is an annual meeting in Dubai, bringing together innovators and researchers in medical imaging technology from around the world.</p>
<h2>3. XYZ.ai at MAI 2020 </h2>
<p>8 to 11 May, 2020</p>
<p> At MAI 2020, we displayed our automated reporting and quantification solutions for X-rays, CT scans and MRIs through interactive demos. It was great to see all the interest in AI in medical imaging. The MAI showcases the most innovative work in the computing industry today—including artificial intelligence and deep learning, virtual reality, self-driving cars, and accelerated analytics.</p>
